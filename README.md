# babel-plugin-style-hook
⚠️ the babel plugin is merged to style-hook [style-hook](https://github.com/style-hook/style-hook)

Now you don't need to install it extra.

In sure you had installed style-hook *@^1.3.2*, then add it to your babel configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "style-hook/babel"
  ]
}
```
